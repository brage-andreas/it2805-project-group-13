					<p>
						Enzo Gorlomi is an Italian chef and owner of Papa's.
						Enzo has transformed the world of pizza with his passion
						and expertise.
						<br /><br />
						Born in Naples, Enzo's culinary journey began in his
						grandmother's kitchen, and today, he stands as a master
						of Neapolitan-style cuisine.
						<br /><br />
						With a dedication to authenticity and quality, Enzo has
						solidified his place as a beloved figure in the world of
						Italian cuisine.

				<h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>

				<div class="indent">
					<p>
						The purpose and goals of Papa's is to inform new
						customers about Papa's; what Papa's is and what Papa's
						offers, as well as acting as a link between hungry
						customers and the cooks.
						<br /><br />
						The website will show customers the rich menu and the
						golden history, and the cozy essence of Papa's through
						our hand-crafted design. We will have a dedicated page
						to Papa's menu, include Enzo's and Papa's lovely and
						rich backstory, as well as a contact form to get in
						touch with Papa's.
					</p>

					<p>
						Papa's audience consists mainly of young adults,
						couples, and families looking for that little extra.
						<br /><br />
						Users would want to find and read about menu items;
						their history, their allergens, their ingredients, and
						the price. Some users may want to contact Papa's; be it
						for reserving a table for their whole family, or asking
						for their lost jacket. Other users may want to read
						about Papa's history and the culture surrounding it.

				<h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
				<p>
					Our navigation structure will be very simple as our project
					is for a restaurant. Every page will have access to every
					page. That way it will be easy for our customers to navigate
					wherever they want whenever they want. This makes the most
					sense as our website will not have any private pages or any
					pages in a hierarchy. You do not need to visit "about us"
					and read about the restaurants history before you check out
					the menu. Those who want to read more about our website will
					do that, those who just want to see the menu will do that.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
				<p>
					The general layout of the pages of our website consists of a
					header containing a navigation bar with links to all of the
					pages on our website. This ensures that the user always has
					access to the pages they need. The header will also contain
					a small section informing of whether the restaurant is open
					or closed based on the current time, and whether we have any
					available tables. The header will also contain the
					restaurants logo and name, guaranteeing that our client's
					profiles is shared with the visitors.

				<h3>Automatically updating open/closed element</h3>
				<p>
					This component in the header will check the current time to
					see whether it should display as an open or closed variant.
				</p>

				<h3>Button updates based on path</h3>
				<p>
					This button will update its styling based on whether the
					current url path matches its target.
