					<p>
						Enzo Gorlomi is an Italian chef and owner of Papa's.
						Enzo has transformed the world of pizza with his passion
						and expertise.
						<br /><br />
						Born in Naples, Enzo's culinary journey began in his
						grandmother's kitchen, and today, he stands as a master
						of Neapolitan-style cuisine.
						<br /><br />
						With a dedication to authenticity and quality, Enzo has
						solidified his place as a beloved figure in the world of
						Italian cuisine.

				<h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>

				<div class="indent">
					<p>
						The purpose and goals of Papa's is to inform new
						customers about Papa's; what Papa's is and what Papa's
						offers, as well as acting as a link between hungry
						customers and the cooks.
						<br /><br />
						The website will show customers the rich menu and the
						golden history, and the cozy essence of Papa's through
						our hand-crafted design. We will have a dedicated page
						to Papa's menu, include Enzo's and Papa's lovely and
						rich backstory, as well as a contact form to get in
						touch with Papa's.
					</p>

					<p>
						Papa's audience consists mainly of young adults,
						couples, and families looking for that little extra.
						<br /><br />
						Users would want to find and read about menu items;
						their history, their allergens, their ingredients, and
						the price. Some users may want to contact Papa's; be it
						for reserving a table for their whole family, or asking
						for their lost jacket. Other users may want to read
						about Papa's history and the culture surrounding it.
					</p>

				<h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
				<p>
					Our navigation structure will be very simple as our project
					is for a restaurant. Every page will have access to every
					page with the exception of the order form page. That way it
					will be easy for our customers to navigate wherever they
					want whenever they want. This makes the most sense as our
					website will not have any private pages or any pages in a
					hierarchy. You do not need to visit "about us" and read
					about the restaurants history before you check out the menu.
					Those who want to read more about our website will do that,
					those who just want to see the menu will do that. The order
					form page is hierarchically underneath the order page as
					everyone who wants to order should read the info at the
					order page before sending in an order form.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
				<p>
					When coming up with the design, we were focused on giving
					the users the impression of a warm and cozy restaurant. We
					therefore decided to use a lot of warm and dark tones.In
					other words, the color scheme is composed of different
					shades of orange and black. At the same time we want to make
					sure the page is simple and easy to use. The navigation bar
					is located at the top of the page. Access to all tabs lie in
					the navigation bar, so it'll be easy for customers to
					navigate on the page. The footer includes copyright
					information, as well as contact information and the address.
					The nav bar and footer uses the color #F2C063, the
					background uses the color #FAE2B7 and any elements on the
					page will use #FDD78F. All text and and icons will use the
					color #1E1E1E. The Papa's logo will use the font Berkshire
					Swash, the page titles will use the font Jolly lodger and
					all other text will use the font Lexend.

				<h2>Content</h2>
				<h3>Homepage</h3>
				<p>
					The homepage's purpose is to welcome the visitor into the
					warm atmosphere of Papa's restaurant. To accomplish this
					goal, we decided to add a grand picture of Papa's restaurant
					along the beautiful landscape next to it to further interest
					the visitor. We also added a welcome message along our
					motto(?) to greet the visitor, because everyone is welcome
					at Papa's! Obviously, Papa's is not all words and empty
					promises; We want our client to experience the wonderful
					taste of Italian cuisine! As such we include three links;
					one that directs the user to our menu-page, one to direct
					the user to our about us page, and one to direct the user to
					make-an-order page, all the aforementioned pages will be
					discussed further down in this document.
				</p>
				<h3>Menu-page</h3>
				<p>
					Our Menu-page is designed to be easily readable and have a
					clear and crisp design. The page is divided into two
					sections: one for our pizzas and one for our pastas. We plan
					to add further menu items to the website in the future,
					especially a drink section. The website then explains a
					little about our preparation process for those who are
					interested. We keep the description short and concise so as
					not to overwhelm the visitor with too much information; In
					the end we want our would-be customer to get to taste our
					great work and not just read about it! All our pizzas and
					pastas are placed within their own boxes with the name of
					the pizza, a brief description, list of ingredients and
					allergens, and a more thorough history/about paragraph for
					those who are interested. We decided to present our dishes
					in this manner to make them stand out such that the
					page-visitors can easily find what they want to eat and
					order it swiftly! This page fulfills the goal of showing the
					menu to our visitors
				</p>

				<h3>Order-now page</h3>
				<p>
					Our order-now page functions as a lead-in page to the
					place-your-order page and as such it's very simple in
					design. The visitor is greeted with an image of one of our
					recognisable pizza-mopeds, while the text informs the user
					about our process of delivery and how long it's expected to
					take. The ‚Äúplace an order‚Äù button takes the user directly to
					the place-your-order page.
				</p>

				<h3>Place-your-order page</h3>
				<p>
					Our place-your-order page is very simple in design: there
					are empty fields that need to be filled in by the customer.
					We ask for their full name, address, phone number, email
					address, the food items and the drink items. The user can
					then choose to send the order, which will take them to a
					webpage where they fill out the payment details (not a part
					of our website), or to go back to the order now page from
					which they can navigate to other sections of the website
					through the navigation bar or footer. We also purposefully
					include a picture of an item from our menu to make the
					would-be customer more appetised.
				</p>
				<h3>Contact</h3>
				<p>
					The contact page will include all the contact information
					related to Papa's. This page will fulfill the goal of
					informing the customers of Papa's about the different ways
					to contact the restaurant. The layout is simple, with three
					boxes containing each piece of contact information. Each of
					these boxes will have a width of 1150px and a height of
					750px. Contact us page The contact us page functions as a
					way of providing the user with the most crucial information
					about our restaurant. This includes a box with information
					about when we take calls and our number, another box that
					contains our email information; one email for general
					inquiries and another one for making reservations, and a
					final box that contains a link to our Facebook for
					information and updates. We chose to include a Facebook link
					since social media branding is important for gaining a
					customer base.
				</p>

				<h3>About us page</h3>
				<p>
					The about us page contains info about our restaurant's
					history, the traditions we hold so dearly, our food, and who
					Enzo Gorlomi is. The page is divided into 4 sections with
					text and image of every section. A different approach to the
					about us page would be to have it as a part of our main page
					and instead let the user scroll down to reveal its content.
					However we chose this approach because we believe it's
					clearer and easier to understand for the average user; our
					main goal is always to accommodate our customers!
