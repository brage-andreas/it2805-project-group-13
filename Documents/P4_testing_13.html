				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<p>
					In order to test the functionality of our website we asked
					our testers to complete four simple tasks and to fill out a
					Google Form with any feedback they may have. Our tasks were:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Task 1 - Find out how much the restaurants' panna cotta
						costs.
					</li>
					<li>
						Task 2 - Find out what the restaurants' phone number is.
					</li>
					<li>Task 3 - Find the restaurants' address.</li>
					<li>
						Task 4 - Place an order. (We informed the testers that
						no actual order would be placed)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<p>
					Most of our testers had no trouble finishing the four tasks.
					We will discuss the details further down in this webpage.
				</p>

				<h2>Tester audience</h2>
				<p>
					We tested the website with users mostly from the target age
					group, although there are some testers outside of that age
					range. The percentage of age groups of our tests were as
					follows: 80% were aged between 20-25 years, 10% aged 15 and
					10% aged 50. This fits with the target audience, as the
					majority of the test group are young adults. At the same
					time, the wide range of ages polled allows us to be more
					confident that most people, regardless of age, would have
					little trouble navigating our website. During the testing
					process we observed some of the testers and noted any
					potential feedback. The feedback will be discussed further
					down this webpage. As for the observations we made, the
					testers seemingly preferred to use the footer and header to
					navigate through the webpage, although a few used the main
					page to navigate. Task one was usually achieved very
					quickly, around 5-10 seconds, although we had one tester
					fail to find the panna-cotta at which point we told them to
					go to the next task. Task two was the task most testers
					finished the quickest, taking approximately 2-8 seconds to
					achieve on average. Most testers scrolled to the footer in
					order to find the phone number, although a few chose to go
					to the contact-us page instead, hence the variation in
					times. Task three had similar results to task two, although
					some testers were confused by the map on our order-now page
					since our restaurant is not a real location. It took the
					testers approximately 5 - 15 seconds to find the address. As
					we anticipated task four took the longest, our testers had
					no issues navigating the website and submitting a fake
					order. This task took approximately 30s - 1.5 minutes to
					finish on average.

				<h2>Testing platforms</h2>
				<p>
					60% of the testers viewed the website on mobile, 30% viewed
					it on computer and the remaining 10% viewed it on Mac.
					Mobile tester also reported the website being difficult to
					use. This makes sense as the webpage is designed to be
					viewed on desktop/laptop. Mobile compatibility is something
					we could add in the future. Furthermore 40% of our testers
					viewed our webpage through Chrome, 20% viewed it through
					Firefox, 20% viewed it through Snapchat, 10% viewed it
					through Edge, and 10% viewed it through Opera. This gives us
					a large variation in different browsers used, which further
					helps us understand the strengths and weaknesses of our
					website, although the biggest issue was clearly the lack of
					mobile compatibility.
				</p>

				<h2>Feedback summary</h2>
				<p>
					Overall feedback on the web page's design was positive. A
					lot of the testers complained that there was no popup after
					placing an order. Such a popup would redirect the user to a
					third-party website to sort the payment, which was beyond
					the scope of this assignment. In hindsight, we could have
					added a small window popup which displays "order placed" as
					a confirmation. Another highly requested feature was to make
					the Papa's logo re-direct the user to the main page. This
					thought did not cross our minds while making the website,
					although we definitely agree that such a feature should be
					implemented. Some testers requested the website to be more
					dynamic. This was especially requested by mobile phone users
					as the website was not designed for mobile phones in mind.
					Other testers requested a function which would allow the
					user to reserve a table. We agree that such a function would
					be a nice addition to our webpage. Others did not like
					specific design choices, ranging from disliking the
					color-scheme to disliking the sectioning of the website.
					This is something we consider as we continue to develop the
					webpage. Feedback on how easy our webpage is to navigate was
					mostly positive, although the mobile phone users had some
					trouble navigating through our website. This is also taken
					into account.

				<h2>Our response</h2>
				<p>
					As we mentioned throughout this document our number one
					priority would be to implement mobile compatibility. Most
					people nowadays use their phones to surf the web, it is
					therefore important to add mobile functionality to the
					webpage so we can reach as big of an audience as possible.
					Furthermore, we would focus on making our webpage more
					dynamic in general. Another functionality we would like to
					add would be the possibility to press the Papa's logo to go
					to the main page. A popup window confirming the order would
					also be a nice addition. Additionally, we could possibly add
					multiple languages to our website. Lastly, we would want to
					add a feature allowing the user to reserve a table.

				<h2>Self-reflection</h2>
				<p>
					Seeing as this was a group project, we found it to be an
					incredibly academically enriching experience. Planning how
					to distribute tasks amongst the group members, working
					together, and finalizing the assignment helped us experience
					how it is to work in a group of likeminded individuals with
					a shared goal. We believe that this experience will be
					incredibly useful to us when we start working in companies
					after we are done with university. Additionally, working
					together allowed us to help each other better understand
					HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web-design in general.
					Furthermore, working on a full website was really motivating
					and we are proud of our final product.
